# Deep Learning and CNNs

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to learn and extract features from data. It excels at tasks involving large amounts of unstructured data such as images, audio, and text.

## Why are CNNs Used?

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning architecture most commonly used for image-related tasks, such as classification, object detection, and segmentation.

**Key reasons CNNs are used:**
- **Feature Extraction:** CNNs automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images using convolutional layers.
- **Parameter Efficiency:** Convolutions use shared weights, reducing the number of parameters compared to traditional neural networks and improving generalization.
- **Translation Invariance:** By scanning local patches in images, CNNs are robust to shifts and distortions.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance:** CNNs power many of the most accurate and efficient solutions in computer vision, outperforming previous methods.

In summary, CNNs are widely adopted in deep learning because they are efficient, scalable, and particularly effective for visual data.
